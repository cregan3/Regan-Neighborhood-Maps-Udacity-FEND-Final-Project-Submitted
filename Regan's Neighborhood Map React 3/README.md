# Neighborhood Map

## This project is built according to the project rubric of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Neighborhood Map Project by Udacity by Christopher Regan to finish the Grow-with-Google Scholarship
This app helps the user find some of the best restaurants in New York City according to ME, Christopher Regan, a local. The default is that all of the places are shown as pinpoints on the google map that is displayed. You can choose to hide or show all the points with the so-labeled buttons. If you want more precision you can either select one of the restaurants from the menu or type something into the search box such as part of a restaurant name, type of restaurant, deals and specialties, or address and press the search button.
